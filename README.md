# About
Our application "Wasted" solves the problem of restaurants/markets/shops throwing out tons of good food every day simply because they didn't use it all. We tackled this issue by creating an application where businesses can upload food which they are going to throw in the trash. Users can then see what food items are available near them and go and buy them for a much cheaper price.

During the first iteration we created a Windows Application with .NET frontend and backend. Technologies:
- Frontend: Windows Forms, C#, .NET
- Backend: plain C#, .NET

During the second iteration we are moving our frontend to a cross-platform framework React Native. Technologies:
- Frontend: React Native, Typescript, NPM, Jest
- Backend: C#, ASP.NET

# Setup
## Frontend
In order to run the mobile application, we need to setup some tools first. The instructions are different for Mac and Windows operating systems.

1. Open [official docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Follow the "React Native CLI Quickstart" guide with "Development OS" selected as your machine's OS and "Target OS" as iOS(macOS only) or Android(macOS and Windows). Complete all the steps until "Creating a new application" section.
2. Clone this repository.
3. `cd se-wasted-app/frontend/wasted-app` to navigate to frontend source directory.
4. `npm install` to install the dependencies to your local `node_modules` directory.
5. `npm run start` to open Expo server, from where you can launch the application on a simulator or your physical device.
